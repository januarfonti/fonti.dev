## Intro

Here you can find a collection of tools that I've built using React.js. You can also find the source code on the page. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me on Twitter [@januarfonti](https://twitter.com/januarfonti).

## Prerequisites

On this playgrounds, I'm using the UI components from [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui). For example, I'm using the `Button`, `Input` and `Toast` component from that library. 

```tsx
import { useToast } from '@/hooks/use-toast'
import { Button } from '@/components/ui/button'
import { Input } from '@/components/ui/input'
```

Please refer to the [shadcn/ui](https://github.com/shadcn/ui) documentation for more installation instructions.

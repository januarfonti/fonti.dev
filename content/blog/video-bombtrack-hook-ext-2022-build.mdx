As my Bombtrack Hook EXT 2022 frameset was still unsold and I had registered for the Surga 2022 event, I decided to rebuild it at Chain and Sprocket. The components are mostly the same as before, except for the saddle and dropbar which I replaced with new ones that had already been sold. The parts I used are as follows:

- Bombtrack Hook EXT 2022 frameset
- Shimano GRX 810 groupset
- Giant PR 2 wheelset
- Fizik Antares R3 saddle
- PRO LT Gravel 42cm dropbar
- Veloci Jazzy 90mm stem
- Panaracer Gravel King SK 700x38c tires

As the year 2022 comes to a close, it is time to reflect on all the amazing things that have happened. For me, it was a year of great personal and professional success. One of the biggest highlights was getting engaged to my girlfriend, a moment that I will always treasure. It was also my fourth year working with ClearView, and I am proud of all that we have accomplished together.

Along with my professional successes, I also had some incredible adventures in 2022. I joined several amazing bicycle events, such as TDA 2022, Demi Apa by Terpancal, Surga 2022, and many more. I also went on a road trip with my family, traveling from Malang to Solo, Jogja, Magelang, Semarang, Cirebon, Bandung, and Bekasi. And, for the first time, I traveled to Bangka Island. Unfortunately, my GoPro died during this trip, but the memories will last a lifetime.

## 2023

As I look ahead to 2023, I have high hopes that it will be my happiest year yet. I am getting married in April, and I am excited to start this new chapter in my life with my future wife. I also have some goals for the year, such as being more productive and organized, learning more about ReactJS and Next.JS, traveling more to new places, and joining more bicycle events, particularly gravel bike events.

Overall, 2022 has been an amazing year, and I can not wait to see what 2023 has in store. I am looking forward to the new challenges and opportunities that come my way and I am ready to face it all head-on. Thank you for being a part of my journey and I hope you will join me as I continue to share my experiences and adventures in the year to come.

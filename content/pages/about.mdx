Welcome to my personal site! My name is Januar Fonti, and I'm a Front-End Developer with over six years of experience in the field. Over the past four years, I have honed my skills as a remote worker, which has allowed me to effectively collaborate with teams from different parts of the world.

My primary tech stack includes JavaScript, TypeScript, Vue, Nuxt, and TailwindCSS. While I continue to use Vue in my professional work, I've recently started exploring React.js with Next.js as a framework for my hobby projects, including this site.
